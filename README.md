TIC TAC TOE

We are going to build a two-player tic-tac-toe game, which we can play in the GUI (made by tkinter).
Initially, we’ll make an empty game board and then we’ll take inputs from the players and we’ll check for the winning condition.
if the whole board gets filled and no one wins, we’ll declare the result as “Draw” and restart the game.
The game is restarted after every match results.

We will build this game using Python 3 and tkinter tools for GUI.
First of all, define the tk window with the Tk() as the root variable.
Then we create the title of the window.
Next, we define a variable to store the playable character(say, ‘O’ and ‘X’ at random).
Then we define a list to store all the buttons and place them in the window.
Finally, we display a label saying the character which has to be played next.
We end by a root.mainloop() function to keep events on the main window active and all other widgets interactive.

ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

It is a game with three choices: rock, paper, and scissors. Two players can play this game at a time. Each one has to choose from the three options available.

In this we will be making a rock-paper-scissor game in which, you are going to play against your computer. The rules of the game are listed below:

If one player chooses the rock, and the other chooses the scissor, rock wins.
If one player chooses the rock, and the other player chooses paper, paper wins.
If one player chooses the scissor, and the other player chooses paper, scissor wins.
If both the choices are the same, then no one will win. Both the user and the computer will not get a point.

After each match/play we will have the results display in message box and the game will restart.
Then you will get an interface with three buttons: Rock, Paper, and Scissor. You can then click any of those buttons to start the game.

We will build this game using Python 3 and tkinter tools for GUI.
First of all, define the tk window with the Tk() as the root variable.
Then we create the title of the window.
Lets mark a random choise for computer and the input choise of these user is stored.
Then let us define a function to compare the choises.
We end by a root.mainloop() function to keep events on the main window active and all other widgets interactive
